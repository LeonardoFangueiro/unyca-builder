# blueprints/game-competitive-platform/1.0.0/servers/apis/tasks/main.yml — apis role — tasks
**Status:** Stable | **Owner:** Platform | **Since:** 2025-08-31 | **Last Updated:** 2025-08-31  
**Purpose:** Demonstration role: validates pass-through of `vars` and `blueprint_meta` by printing them.

## Responsibilities
- Consume host-level `vars` and global `blueprint_meta`.
- Act as a placeholder for real configuration tasks.

**Not responsible for:**
- Inventory construction; schema validation; snapshotting; manifest verification.

## Public API / Invocation
Imported by the orchestrator play; no public API.

## Data Contracts
**Inputs**
- Host variables under `hostvars[<inventory_hostname>]['vars']`.
- `blueprint_meta` (global).

**Outputs**
- None (demo role prints data).

## Control Flow
Sequential Ansible tasks; simple flow.

## Error Handling & Exit Codes
Task failure aborts this role; upstream play handles error propagation.

## Logging & Observability
Logs appear in the orchestrator's captured output file.

## Security Considerations
No secret persistence; ensure tasks do not echo sensitive values.

## Edge Cases & Limitations
Purely illustrative; replace with real tasks for the target system.

## Examples
N/A

## Change Log (high-level)
- 2025-08-31: initial demo role documentation.
